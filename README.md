# AMAZON-User-Segmentation
 Making predictions to understand different clusters based on different parameters using machine learning techniques, to find which customer is likely to purchase or not on Amazon.

 In the dataset used, we are considering Amazon.com. We are trying to predict for Amazon which wants to understand different clusters based on different parameters. For example Sex, Age, Income, and then the Rating of the person. Amazon rates the people based upon these parameters that this particular person is very likely to purchase and this one not. This is the internal prediction basis for different types of machine learning models. But this is what to cluster people so that they can run different E-Mail campaigns, Different Advertisements, and so on.
